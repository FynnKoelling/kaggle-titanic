# Kaggle Competition - Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains the code that has been written for the Kaggle competition "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster". The goal is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. The focus lies on two important concepts: Correct training in connection to **Data Leakage** and correct **Evaluation** in connection to Train Set, Validation Set and Test Set. For more information see the notebook itself.

The following techniques were used in the project:
- Data analysis and visualizations using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn
- Feature engineering using pandas
- Use of pipelines and transformers to prevent data leakage using sklearn
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models using sklearn
- Hyperparametertuning using Cross-Fold-Validation using sklearn
